## Abstract
One of the most important aspects of our project is vehicle monitoring. This technology is utilised to determine the existence of the passenger, and if the passenger exists, our system begins the functioning. So, nowadays, everything is getting automated, and everyone is seeking for new items to make their lives simpler. The primary goal of our project is to design and create a system capable of monitoring the existence of passengers as well as heat monitoring and display.
